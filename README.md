# Iryte On Web

## About

This is the web version of the Iryte app, currently under development. It is meant to be a test and showcase of Flutter's web capabilities as well as its limitations. This build was made in `flutter build web --release` mode. Although there is still much that can be improved upon, this is more of an out-of-the-box experience.

## Iryte

Iryte is an ambitious project that aims to be a simple yet perfect note-taking app, with the focus being on writing. That's why it's called "I write". Wish me luck, as there are endless possibilities ahead.
